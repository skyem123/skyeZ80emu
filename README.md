# skyeZ80emu [![Travis build staus](https://img.shields.io/travis/skyem123/skyeZ80emu.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/skyem123/skyeZ80emu)

**ABANDONED FOR NOW** I don't have the time to work on this anymore, and I don't really enjoy picking apart the sparse documentation, so I'm leaving this here, but I don't expect to work on it any time soon.

While this project might not be completed, the good news is that it has got to the point where it "sort of" works, and is Turing complete enough to run a RPN calculator.

I started this because I wanted a Z80 emulator for a project idea I had, I would've used a pre-existing one, but [@Victorious3](https://github.com/Victorious3) told me to make my own...

Fun fact, [@Victorious3](https://github.com/Victorious3) and [@RX14](https://github.com/RX14) were connected to a screenshare session on my computer and helped me code it. I also worked with [@Achati](https://github.com/Achati) by connecting to a screenshare session on his computer.

Thanks to [@RX14](https://github.com/RX14) for the Jenkins build server!

Also, thank you [@gamemanj](https://github.com/gamemanj) for writing a lot of code to help me.
