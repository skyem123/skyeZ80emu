This is a project idea made by someone who thinks they're idiotic, and focuses so much on this thought it's a little ridiculous.
It might not be completed.

I wanted a Z80 emulator for a project idea I had, I would've used a pre-existing one, but [@Victorious3](https://github.com/Victorious3) told me to make my own...

Fun fact, [@Victorious3](https://github.com/Victorious3) and [@RX14](https://github.com/RX14) were connected to a screenshare session on my computer and helped me code it. I also worked with [@Achati](https://github.com/Achati) by connecting to a screenshare session on his computer.

Thanks to [@RX14](https://github.com/RX14) for the Jenkins build server!

Also, thank you [@gamemanj](https://github.com/gamemanj) for writing a lot of code to help me.
