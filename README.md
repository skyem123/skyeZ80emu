This is a very stupid project idea made by a very idiotic person. It might not be completed.

I wanted a Z80 emulator for a project idea I had, I would've used a pre-existing one, but [@Victorious3](https://github.com/Victorious3) told me to make my own...

Fun fact, [@Victorious3](https://github.com/Victorious3) and [@RX14](https://github.com/RX14) were connected to a screenshare session on my computer and helped me code it.
